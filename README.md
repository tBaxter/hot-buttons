Hot Buttons
=================

Are based on the work of Wouter and CSS Tricks, implemented in SASS, and designed to be quickly configurable and reusable in a variety of situations.

They support font icons, sub-buttons, sub-navigation, dividers and more. They are designed to be easily configurable, with sensible defaults you can easily override for your project.

Plus, they're designed to easily plug in your own icon fonts and SASS variables.

You can create text-only buttons, icon-only buttons, or buttons with both. 

You can also have buttons with sub-buttons, sub-navigation, "thinline buttons", and divided buttons.

For some demos, [visit the github pages](http://tbaxter.github.io/hot-buttons/) or download the project and view the index.html, but remember, those are just the default settings. You can configure them however you like.
